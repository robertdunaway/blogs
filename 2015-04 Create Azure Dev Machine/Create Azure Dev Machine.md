#Create an Azure Dev Machine

###http://robertdunaway.github.io

###Why
- Experiment with technologies we don’t desire to or can’t install locally.
- Set up a Virtual Machine for teaching and clone it for students.

###Steps

 1. With your MSDN Subscription, log into the New Azure Portal.

     - portal.azure.com
     -  You’ll need to enable your MSDN Azure subscription or create a “Pay as you go” subscription.  Then wait for the subscription service to be activated before continuing.

 2. Select the “New” button in the bottom left.
