#The Future of UI is 3D
I’m not a UI expert.  I’m not creating bleeding edge UI design guidelines and tools to build the next generation of User Interfaces.  I’m just another programmer who sees the writing on the wall and who’s keeping an interested eye on the horizon.

##The client stack
The latest evolution in the Modern Web brings performant client applications capable of running on all platforms with a single code base.  

What’s next?

##The 3D UI
I’ve been waiting for the tooling and design guidelines for building 3D UIs.  I don’t know the science behind 3D UI but it seems obvious that more information can be communicated to the user faster than can be done with a 2D UI.

Some technologies that are pushing this are **Famo.us, D3JS, and Three.js**.  The combination of these JavaScript libraries with modern Greenfield browsers makes the 3D UI possible.

It seems clear to me, the future of UI development is JavaScript and probably some kind of 3D UI with human interfaces other than the mouse and keyboard.  

**Intel interview: Dave Fetterman inside the Famo.us JavaScript framework**

Dave Fetterman was skeptical about this approach until he saw it demonstrated. Now he’s the architect of a major initiative to speed up DOM manipulation with JavaScript.  New libraries for DOM manipulation with JavaScript are really fast.  Dave Fetterman’s version of the Facebook app uses JavaScript, and when compared to the native running Facebook app, you can’t distinguish the difference. The look, feel, and performance are comparable.

Famo.us works by flattening out the DOM for higher performance.  Browser standards are looking to integrate Famo.us directly into their browsers.  This will be a game changer.

##JARVIS
In the near future, we will stop designing UIs imitating paper forms in favor of 3D designs that share more information quicker, increasing user productivity.

I’m not sure Jarvis is an example of a more productive interface.  It’s just cool.

##3D design guidelines

3D design guidelines are still in the early stages of development, but the end result is supposed to be the ability to create apps that make users much more productive.  The first release of 3D design guidelines should be coming from IEEE mid-2015.

##Holo Lens
This time next year the world might look completely different. Maybe in two years...

Imagine no more monitors. 

Imagine being aided in everything we do with technology.

If you are going for a run down the street a little guy pops up with a stop sign indicating there is a car you didn't see.

Imagine you are in a fire in an unfamiliar place and technology guides you to safety.

Imagine you want to remodel your kitchen and now you can literally walk through the finished product before you begin.

Imagine you are in the kitchen cooking. On the left is a flat screen TV with your favorite show and on the right is a recipe. Only the TV isn't really there and the recipe is 5 feet tall and you can read if from across the room.

This is a game changer...
