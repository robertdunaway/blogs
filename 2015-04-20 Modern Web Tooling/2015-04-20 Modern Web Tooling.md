The **Mashup** is a learning tool that also serves as a bootstrap project for line-of-business applications.


#Modern Web Tooling VS2015

Here are a few tools you’ll be seeing a lot of.
<br/>

###NUGET

Package manager for server side code in Visual Studio.

###BOWER

Package manager for Modern Web client libraries.
NOTE: Visual Studio 2015 projects install with a basic Bower setup.

###NPM

Node Package Manager – Client side development tools
<br/>
>NOTE: Visual Studio 2015 installs with a version of NODEJS (can be reconfigured for IOJS).  NPM is the package manager that comes with NODEJS.  Get used to seeing this because it’s an integral part of VS2015.

###GRUNT

Task runner for client side development.  Configuration based.

###GULP

Task runner for client side development. Programming based.

###PROJECT.JSON & CONFIG.JSON

These are the new configuration files used by VS2015.  The  project.csproj file is no more.
<br/>
This is a huge improvement.  Contention with the project file and source control on development teams is gone.  No more will you add a file to your project and check it in only to learn your other developers don’t see the file as part of the project.
<br/>
A little reading on this.

###GLOBS

Globs are a syntax for identifying files.  The base assumption is all files are included and the GLOB identifies files to exclude.  Or something like that.
<br/>

<br/>
If you do any work in GitHub, and all the cool kids are, then you’ve seen gitignore.  http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore  This is how you keep from committing source control sins like checking in files that are generated by our code.
<br/>
**Visual Studio** uses Glob in it’s project.json and config.json files.
<br/>
**Grunt** uses Glob in it’s GruntConfig.json file.
<br/>
**Gulp** use Glob for it’s gruntconfig.json file.
<br/>
These are what I’ve run into but Glog is becoming and industry standard for identifying and excluding files from “a thing”.
